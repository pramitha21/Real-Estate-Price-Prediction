# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
This project is a web application that predicts house prices based on user input. The app is built using Streamlit and uses a linear regression model trained on real estate data from Kaggle. The dataset underwent extensive data cleaning and feature engineering to prepare it for training.

The machine learning model is implemented using linear regression and integrated into the app using Streamlit.

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and underwent thorough data cleaning and feature engineering steps. For detailed insights into the data preparation and model training process, please refer to the Jupyter notebook file (Prediction.ipynb).

Features Predicts house prices based on user input. Easy-to-use web interface built with Streamlit. Accepts inputs like location, total square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. Displays the estimated price using a trained linear regression model.

Getting Started Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites Python 3.7 or higher

Installation Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-price-prediction.git cd real-estate-price-prediction

Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt Run Locally Make sure your virtual environment is activated (if using one).

Start the Streamlit app: streamlit run streamlit.py The app will open in your default web browser.

Usage Open the app in your browser.

Enter the required details:

Location Total square footage Number of bedrooms Number of bathrooms Click the Predict button. View the estimated price.

Model Details The model is a linear regression model trained using scikit-learn.

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and preprocessed using: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and outliers. Data cleaning to handle missing values and inconsistencies. Feature engineering to encode categorical variables and improve model performance.

For details on data preparation and model training, refer to the Prediction.ipynb file.
